# dojopizzeria

### In this assignment we'll be making pizzas in JavaScript! And if we're going to just make one pizza we can define it all at once like the sandwich we see below.

var sandwich = {
    bread:    "sourdough",
    protein:  "london broil",
    cheese:   "lacey swiss cheese",
    toppings: ["romaine lettuce", "heirloom tomatoes", "horseradish sauce"]
};
    
console.log(sandwich);copy
But what if we wanted to make multiple sandwiches? We could define a function that allows us to craft a sandwich!

function sandwichFactory(bread, protein, cheese, toppings) {
    var sandwich = {};
    sandwich.bread = bread;
    sandwich.protein = protein;
    sandwich.cheese = cheese;
    sandwich.toppings = toppings;
    return sandwich;
}
    
var s1 = sandwichFactory("wheat", "turkey", "provolone", ["mustard", "fried onions", "arugula"]);
console.log(s1);copy
The Pizza Oven
Create a function called pizzaOven. We should feel free to customize what information we keep track of for our pizza, but let's make sure that we include the following: crustType, sauceType, cheeses, and toppings.
